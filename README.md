# Overview

This application provides forms for Soundside Church in Tacoma, WA. Forms can be accessed via '/forms/:form-name'. Submissions can be found at '/submissions'. Submissions are organized by date and form type on the backend and transferred into CSV's on the frontend.

The backend may be found here: https://github.com/jls-github/soundside-forms-backend 

# Roadmap

- Phase one: Forms are hard-coded on the frontend and organized into CSV files for the administrators to access.
